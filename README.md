# My GitHub Tutorial

Whakatau mai!

By now, you should have completed the following basic tasks within your own `my-git-tutorial` repository, or are confident enough to proceed:
- [x] Repository creation with GitHub
- [x] Editing a file directly on GitHub
- [x] Cloning a repository to your local machine
- [x] Editing a file on your local machine and pushing it upstream (to the remote, which is GitHub)
- [x] Fetching and pulling upstream changes to your local machine
- [x] Auto-merging of a file that was simultaneously edited in two places
- [x] Manually resolving a simple merge conflict

This template repository is now provided for you to practice using GitHub's project management features, which you may find helpful towards completing your ELECTENG/COMPSYS 209 project.

This repository will also walk you through some more examples of branching and conflict resolution.

Within your project, you may choose to use:  
| GitHub Feature | Potential Application                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Projects       | To get a big-picture view of all the tasks within your project, and their statuses.                                          |
| Issues         | To track each individual project task.                                                                                       |
| Wikis          | To store your team contract, meeting agendas/minutes, team logbooks, theoretical calculations, technical documentation, etc. |
| Pull Requests  | To review new changes as a team before they are merged into `main`.                                                          |
